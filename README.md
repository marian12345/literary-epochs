# literary-epochs

A simple web app displaying and explaining many different literary eras.

A work in process...

## To see it live, go to:

```

```

The App is fetching data from a strapi backend which is currently deployed on fly.io.
Since this is a free plan, loading the data might take a few seconds when visiting the website for the first time.
